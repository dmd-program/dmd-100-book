# Develop: Feedback

You will now evaluate assigned peer work and provide feedback.

## Peer Feedback Guidelines

Provide feedback on your classmates' open design projects. When providing feedback, think and address the following: 

1. Does the toy kit offer an opportunity for creative, novel, or compelling play?
2. How does it compare to existing toys/kits you might know? 
3. Are the kit instructions clear, easy to follow, and engaging in their design? 
4. Is it truly modular, and can it be assembled into three distinctly different objects?
5. Share any other comments/thoughts for improvements you may have.

## Post work

Use the indicated file format. You must obtain prior approval to deviate from these requirements.

1. Post the corresponding feedback as a comment in the relevant discussion thread.
2. Combine all the feedback you've written and upload to this assignment's submission text field or upload an MS Word document.
