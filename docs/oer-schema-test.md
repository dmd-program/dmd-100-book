# OER Schema Plugin Test Page

This page demonstrates the OER Schema plugin components that are now available in this VitePress book.

## Learning Objectives

::: learning-objective skill="analyze design principles" course="DMD-100"
Students will be able to identify and analyze fundamental design principles including balance, contrast, emphasis, and unity in various design contexts.
:::

## Content Section

Here's some regular content about design principles. The learning objective above includes structured metadata that search engines and educational platforms can understand.

## Practice Exercise

::: practice action="Observing,Analyzing" material="design-examples"
**Exercise: Design Principles Analysis**

### Materials Needed:
- Collection of design examples (provided)
- Analysis worksheet
- Pen or pencil

### Instructions:
1. Choose three different design examples from the provided collection
2. For each example, identify which design principles are most prominent
3. Analyze how these principles contribute to the overall effectiveness
4. Document your findings on the worksheet
:::

## Assessment

::: assessment type="Quiz" points="15" assessing="design-principles-knowledge"
**Design Principles Quiz**

1. Define the principle of contrast and give an example
2. How does balance affect user perception in interface design?
3. Identify the emphasis technique used in the provided design sample
:::

## Reflection Component

::: learning-component action="Reflecting" objective="design-principles-understanding"
**Personal Reflection**

Think about the design principles you've learned today. Look around your immediate environment and identify examples of:
- Balance (symmetrical or asymmetrical)
- Contrast (color, size, or texture)
- Emphasis (focal points)

Write a brief reflection on how understanding these principles might change how you view everyday objects and spaces.
:::

## Instructional Pattern Example

::: instructional-pattern type="Case Study" title="Analyzing the Apple iPhone Design"
This instructional pattern demonstrates how to conduct a comprehensive design analysis using the principles learned in this lesson.

**Step 1: Initial Observation**
Document your first impressions without analysis

**Step 2: Systematic Analysis**
Apply each design principle methodically

**Step 3: Synthesis**
Combine findings into comprehensive understanding
